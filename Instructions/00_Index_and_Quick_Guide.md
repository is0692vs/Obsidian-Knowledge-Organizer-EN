## üìÅ Instruction File List

### Basic Configuration

- [[01_Project Overview]] - About the project, directory structure roles, current status
- [[02_Link Management]] - Most important principles, verification protocols, batch work methods
- [[03_Directory Structure and Placement Rules]] - Directory structure, placement criteria

- [[07_Index Management]] - Required update target files, update formats
- [[08_Troubleshooting]] - Broken link detection and repair, common errors
- [[09_Link Creation Criteria and Guidelines]] - Term extraction, linking criteria, quality guidelines

## üéØ Efficiency-focused Operations Policy

### [IMPORTANT] Required Rules When Creating Links

- **Links containing slashes must be replaced with \_ (underscore)**
- Example: [[CI/CD]] ‚Üí [[CI_CD]], [[HTML/CSS]] ‚Üí [[HTML_CSS]]
- Reason: Obsidian misinterprets slashes as directory separators

### Principles for Work Time Reduction

1. **Rapid decision making**: Decide file placement by first impression (don't hesitate)
2. **Content moderation**: Don't aim for perfection, basic information is sufficient
3. **Utilize parallel processing**: Execute creation of 10 files in parallel
4. **Template utilization**: Copy & modify existing similar files as reference

### Balance of Quality and Efficiency

- **Minimum quality standard**: 100+ characters, 2+ [[]] links, basic structure
- **Completion level**: 60-70% is sufficient (can be improved later)
- **Zero broken links**: Absolute condition (priority over quality)

## ‚úÖ Completion Checklist

**Always confirm before completing all work:**

- [ ] 1st broken link check: Confirmed no broken links using grep_search
- [ ] 2nd broken link check: Confirmed overall integrity using semantic_search
- [ ] 3rd broken link check: Confirmed verification with file structure index
- [ ] File structure index.md updated to latest state
- [ ] Basic content written in newly created files
- [ ] Words.md or Articles.md updated
- [ ] Reported list of created/updated files
- [ ] **Additional confirmation**: Individually confirmed existence of newly created files using file_search
- [ ] **Final confirmation**: Guaranteed zero broken links state through multi-stage verification
