## Instructions for AI Agents

When adding term files to this directory:

1. Use official names for languages and frameworks
2. Record version information when important
3. Choose code examples that are concise and easy to understand
4. Clearly distinguish between language-specific and universal concepts
5. Consider subdirectory creation if terms in the same category exceed 5 items
