## üîÑ Dynamic Directory Management

**Instructions for AI Agents**: When terms in new fields that don't fit existing categories accumulate (5 or more), create new directories following these steps:

1. **Update this file (00-Words.md)**: Add new directory description to the Category Structure section
2. **Create new directory**: Words/{NewDirectoryName}/
3. **Create directory description file**: 00-Words-{NewDirectoryName}.md (in the directory)
4. **Update file index**: Add new category section to the main file index
5. **Update README.md**: Reflect new category in project root README.md

**Examples of new categories**:

- QuantumComputing/ (Quantum computing terms)
- Blockchain/ (Blockchain and cryptographic technology)
- MachineLearning/ (Machine learning and AI terms)
- GameDevelopment/ (Game development terms)
- Biotechnology/ (Biotechnology terms)
- IoT/ (IoT and edge computing)
- AR_VR/ (Augmented reality and virtual reality)

## How to Use This Folder

This folder collects important terms that form the foundation of the knowledge base. When adding new terms, consider the following points:

1. **Front matter** - Basic information like title, created, tags
2. **Concise definition** - Write a concise definition at the beginning
3. **Structured content** - Structure logically using headings
4. **Cross-links** - Links to other related terms
5. **External links** - Links to official sites and documentation

## üîß Automated Processing by AI Agents

Terms in this folder are automatically processed by AI agents for:

1. **Term extraction**: Identify technical terms, names, service names from articles
2. **Duplicate checking**: Check for duplicates and notation variations with existing terms
3. **Classification**: Categorize into appropriate folders
4. **File creation**: Create corresponding Markdown files for each term
5. **Link generation**: Build bidirectional links with related terms
6. **Index updates**: Add new terms to relevant index files

## üìù Standard Structure for Term Files

Each term file follows this structure:

```markdown
# Term Name

## Overview

- ((Related Term 1)) - Use [[]] syntax when linking to actual existing files

**Important Note for AI Agents**:

- In this documentation, we use (()) for examples to avoid creating broken links

- Only create [[]] links when the target file actually exists
- Never create [[]] links to non-existent example files like [[Sample Article]] or [[Example Term]]
